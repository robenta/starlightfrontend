Hotel Management System (Frontend Redesign)

This project is a redesigned version of a hotel management system I originally built using Python and Django. 
I recreated it as a pure frontend website using only HTML, CSS, and BootStrap to showcase modern UI/UX design skills and responsive layout techniques.

Features:
* Fully redesigned hotel website interface 
* Clean, modern layout built with HTML and CSS 
* Responsive design for all screen sizes 
* Interactive elements using JavaScript 
* Pages for rooms, bookings, services, and contact 
* Focused entirely on frontend presentation without backend logic
  
Purpose:
 The goal of this redesign was to demonstrate strong frontend design skills, improve the overall look and usability of the original Django project, and create a visually appealing version suitable for portfolio display.
